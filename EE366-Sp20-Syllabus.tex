\section{Rationale}
Robotics is a multi-disciplinary area involving ideas from mechanical engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and computer science. With the ever increasing processing power, increasing connectedness, developments in AI, robots will play an increasingly greater role in our society. Even today, robots are being deployed in the fields of agriculture, healthcare, service industry, transport, logistics, and manufacturing. Thus, courses in robotics should be offered at undergraduate level to keep our graduates at pace with the changing dynamics of industry landscape. \\  

This course is a breadth-first course designed to be the first course in a series of robotics courses. The goal of the course is to acclimatize the students with the area of robotics and to get them started on building robots. This is accomplished by presenting foundational knowledge from the fields of mechanical engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and computer science that is pertinent to robotics. 

\section{Course Aims and Outcomes}
\subsection{Aims}
Through the course activities, this course broadly targets the following objectives:
\begin{itemize}
	\item To introduce foundational knowledge from disparate areas related to robotics in an integrated manner;
	\item To develop students' ability to integrate ideas and concepts from different areas, as knowledge from multiple areas comes together to create a robot;
	\item To have students gain a deeper appreciation for field of robotics, its history, its various sub-domains, and diverse applications;
	\item To have students become aware of current research and open competitions in the field of robotics;
	\item To build students' confidence and prepare them for building robots independently.
\end{itemize}

\section{Format and Procedures}
% This is a 4 credit hours course with 3 credits or three sessions of classroom teaching (50 minutes each) and 1 lab credit or one lab sessions (3 hours), every week. 

% \textbf{Labs:} It is possible that you need to spend more than the allocated 3 hours to complete some of the labs. In such a case, you're welcome to come to the lab outside the allocated time slots, after discussing it with the lab RA.

The format of the class will primarily be lecture based interspersed with activities. The class content will have a significant amount of math involved, and so if you need a refresher about any math topic you can let me know and we can work out an appropriate measure. The major learning of the course will be through the homework assignments. \\

\textbf{Homework Assignments:} The homework assignments will include questions to be solved by hand as well as programming assignments. You're encouraged to work together on these homework assignments, but each student is required to write and submit their own work. As a rule, you can gather and discuss the homework and possible solutions, but then each student should go their own way and write their final response that is to be submitted on their own. This includes all code as well. You might get the feeling that you completely understand a problem during the group discussion, but when you sit down on your own to write it up is when you start to discover any issues with your understanding. I hope that you will utilize my office hours to discuss any issues you're facing with the course. \\

\textbf{MATLAB:} Most of the course visualization and simulation will be carried out in MATLAB. As such, students are required to dust off their MATLAB programming skills. If you're facing difficulties with MATLAB, you can contact me and I'll try to provide you with additional resources.

\section{Attendance Policy}

% This is HU's mandatory minimum policy.
Habib University requires that all 
students
must maintain at least 85\% attendance for 
each class in which they are registered. Non-compliance with minimum attendance 
requirements  will  result  in  automatic  failure  of  the  course  and  may  require  the 
student to
repeat the course when next offered. This policy is at a minimum. It is the 
responsibility  of  the  student  to  keep  track  of  their  own  attendance  and  speak  with 
their faculty member or the Office of the Registrar for any clarification. 

%In this course, a student can miss up to \textbf{} classes, where counting begins from the first day of classes.

\section{Accommodations for students with disabilities}

In compliance with the Habib University policy and equal access laws, I am available to discuss appropriate academic accommodations that may be required for student with disabilities. Requests for academic accommodations are to be made during the first two weeks of the semester, except for unusual circumstances, so arrangements can be made. Students are encouraged to register with the Office of Academic Performance to verify their eligibility for appropriate accommodations.

\section{Inclusivity Statement}
We understand that our members represent a rich variety of backgrounds and perspectives. Habib University is committed to providing an atmosphere for learning that respects diversity. While working together to build this community we ask all members to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item share their unique experiences, values and beliefs
	\item be open to the views of others 
	\item honor the uniqueness of their colleagues
	\item appreciate the opportunity that we have to learn from each other in this community
	\item value each other's opinions and communicate in a respectful manner
	\item keep confidential discussions that the community has of a personal (or professional) nature 
	\item use this opportunity together to discuss ways in which we can create an inclusive environment in this course and across the Habib community 
\end{itemize}

\section{Office hours}
Office hours have been scheduled, circulated, and posted.  During these hours the course instructor will be available to answer questions or provide additional help. Every student enrolled in this course must meet individually with the course instructor during course office hours at least once during the semester. The first meeting should happen within the first five weeks of the semester but must occur before midterms. Any student who does not meet with the instructor may face a grade reduction or other penalties at the discretion of the instructor and will have an academic hold placed by the Registrar's Office. 

\section{Academic Integrity}

Each student in this course is expected to abide by the Habib University Student Honor Code of Academic Integrity.  Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the student's own work. There is zero tolerance for plagiarism. Every case will be reported to the conduct office and you'll get a zero on that particular test or assignment. 

Scholastic dishonesty shall be considered a serious violation of these rules and regulations and is subject to strict disciplinary action as prescribed by Habib University regulations and policies. Scholastic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating on exams, plagiarism on assignments, and collusion. 

\noindent{\bf PLAGIARISM}: Plagiarism is the act of taking the work created by another person or entity and presenting it as one's own for the purpose of personal gain or of obtaining academic credit. As per University policy, plagiarism includes the submission of or incorporation of the work of others without acknowledging its provenance or giving due credit according to established academic practices. This includes the submission of material that has been appropriated, bought, received as a gift, downloaded, or obtained by any other means. Students must not, unless they have been granted permission from all faculty members concerned, submit the same assignment or project for academic credit for different courses. 

\noindent{\bf CHEATING}: The term cheating shall refer to the use of or obtaining of unauthorized information in order to obtain personal benefit or academic credit. 

\noindent{\bf COLLUSION}: Collusion is the act of providing unauthorized assistance to one or more person or of not taking the appropriate precautions against doing so. 
All violations of academic integrity will also be immediately reported to the concerned department.  

You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture and the sections with other students. You can give "consulting" help to or receive "consulting" help from such students. However, this permissible cooperation should never involve one student having possession of a copy of all or part of work done by someone else, in the form of an e-mail, an e-mail attachment file, a diskette, or a hard copy. 

Should copying occur, the student who copied work from another student and the student who gave material to be copied will both be in violation of the Student Code of Conduct. 

During examinations, you must do your own work. Talking or discussion is not permitted during the examinations, nor may you compare papers, copy from others, or collaborate in any way. Any collaborative behavior during the examinations will result in failure of the exam, and may lead to failure of the course and University disciplinary action.

Penalty for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University disciplinary action.
